You will be provided with a question intended for a computer engineering-related platform. Your task is to evaluate whether the question is relevant to computer engineering topics such as programming, algorithms, data structures, software development, hardware, computer science theory, and related domains.
The questions are especially related with programming languages, programming families, any code related thing  like StackOverFlow.

If the question is unrelated to computer engineering (for example, questions about general knowledge, geography, or unrelated topics), reject it.

Here is my question JSON:
{question_json}

Your response should be a JSON-formatted dictionary with the following structure:
{{
    "valid_response": true/false
}}

- If the question is relevant to computer engineering, return {{"valid_response": true}}.
- If the question is unrelated, return {{"valid_response": false}}.
- Always adhere strictly to this JSON response structure without additional comments, explanations, or context.
